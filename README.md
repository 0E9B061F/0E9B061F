**Hello there, my name is `0E9B061F`.** I'm a full-stack web developer currently
working mostly with node.js and [Svelte](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte).
I've worked extensively with Ruby and Python in the past. I have an interest in
formal languages and parsing them, and [parsing expression
grammars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar) in
particular. I also write a lot of bash.

# Current Work

I'm currently working on **Commonplace Book**, a wiki built on Svelte. While the
code isn't currently public, you can see an example installation at
[0x2764.com](https://0x2764.com).
