# Hello there, my name is `0E9B061F`

I'm a full-stack web developer currently working mostly with node.js and
[Svelte](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte). I've worked extensively with Ruby
and Python in the past. I have an interest in formal languages and parsing them,
and [parsing expression
grammars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar) in
particular. I also write a lot of bash.

# Current Work

I'm currently working on **Commonplace Book**, a wiki built on Svelte. While the
code isn't currently public, you can see an example installation at
[0x2764.com](https://0x2764.com).

## Past Projects

See my pinned repositories below. I'm interested in parsing (**[ghast.js](https://github.com/0E9B061F/ghast.js)**,
**[lexdoc](https://github.com/0E9B061F/lexdoc)**) and the web (**[fantasma.js](https://github.com/0E9B061F/fantasma.js)**, **[panopticon.js](https://github.com/0E9B061F/panopticon.js)**, **[arkweb](https://github.com/0E9B061F/arkweb)**), and I occasionally create small system utilities (**[addmag](https://github.com/0E9B061F/addmag)**). I mostly work with JavaScript, Python and Ruby.

I've contributed to [svelte-markdown](https://github.com/pablo-abc/svelte-markdown).
